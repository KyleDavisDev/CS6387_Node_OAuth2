## CS6387 Implement OAuth2 client

Hello, this little app is a demo of how OAuth2 could be implemented used `Node` and [Okta](https://www.okta.com/).

This project was built on Node version `v14.18.1` and npm `6.14.15`.

To run the app, first download all the required packages via run:
```
npm install
```

And then
```
npm run start
```

And lastly, open up your browser to:
```
localhost:8080
```

You will likely run into errors along the way as this app uses secret keys that are not publicly available... sorry!
